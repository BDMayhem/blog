        <p>I’ve almost finished Colt Steele’s Web Developer Bootcamp course, and things are starting to click.  It’s a big jump from just HTML/CSS/JS to making a full stack app with dynamic content, data stored in a database, users who can log in, etc., etc.  There are a lot more moving parts, and it’s often unclear where one part starts and the other ends.  </p>
<p>But I think I understand enough of how all the parts work together that I could halfway comprehend enough Stack Overflow questions to make something of my own.  I know that a voting app is part of FCC’s back-end curriculum, but I have an idea about how to implement that sort of thing.  I’ll keep mulling that one over before I commit to spending too much time on it, though.</p>
<p>(And speaking of commit, I’m getting a lot more comfortable with Git, which is nice.  It’s becoming increasingly apparent that Github alone isn’t sufficient.)</p>
<p>I’d also like to go back to FCC and work on their data-visualization and back-end curricula. They’re sparse educationally, but the projects look like they have the right kinds of challenges built into them.  And I think the experience with Node (or perhaps Express) will make the parts of React that I wasn’t catching on to a few months ago more comprehensible.  </p>

        <p>Today I’ve been working on allowing users to add the number of smelting, crafting, etc. stations they have in operation.  That will affect the time required to make the materials in question.</p>
<p>I added a simple number and +/- buttons that would count up or down when clicked.  But in order to do that, it screwed with how the needs and inventory lists are created.  So I reworked it.  Rather than just creating the items it needs, now it creates and hides every item upon load and only unhides the ones needed.  Much easier said than done.  And much easier done in jQuery than vanilla JS.  But a challenge is a challenge, and I’m not using jQuery this time.</p>
<p>Much later I got everything working as it used to (but now with shiny +/- buttons!) and I found another bug.  At least this was an old one, not one I created in this refactor process.</p>
<p>I found that if you have inventory for a material needed more than once, the inventory is counted twice.  Tracking that one down was entertaining, and squashing it was downright fun.</p>
<p>This morning I was able to implement to coal slider, another rewarding accomplishment, especially because I got to work on my new flexbox skills.  </p>
<p>Oh, and because I didn’t want to bother digging out my Photoshop disks, I installed Gimp to work on the background image.  What a clunky, user-hostile thing to inflict on people.  I’d almost call it overpriced.  For similar reasons I downloaded OpenOffice with similar sentiments.  Sigh.</p>

        <p>I’ve spent some of the last couple of days working on styling DTC.  I have limited experience with design, and if I look at just about anything long enough, I can’t tell whether it looks good or bad anymore.  </p>
<p>At this point, I don’t know if what I’ve done looks bad, but it certainly looks nicer than the completely unstyled site that it has been so far.  It looks more like someone put some thought into it.  At the very least, everything has its own space, and it’s responsive.  </p>
<p>As I’ve said before, I’m easily persuaded, and this time, it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kVeCqQCxlk" target="_blank" rel="external">this video</a> that convinced me to use CSS Grid and dive headfirst into the newer methods of laying out pages.  I watched the video again to get the keywords to use, and I was on my way.</p>
<p>And then I was immediately stuck.  It didn’t work.  I didn’t understand what I was doing.  So I read more at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target="_blank" rel="external">CSS-Tricks</a>.  I still didn’t get it, so I checked out examples from <a href="https://gridbyexample.com/examples/" target="_blank" rel="external">Grid by Example</a>.  It still wasn’t working until I got to <a href="https://gridbyexample.com/examples/example13/" target="_blank" rel="external">Redefining Grid Areas with Media Queries</a>.  </p>
<p>Suddenly, it worked perfectly.  Just define your grid areas with names in <code>grid-area</code>, and tell them where to go in the parent by literally creating a grid with those names with <code>grid-template-areas</code>.  No need to worry about telling each row and column where to start and stop–and for the mobile section, it’s just a list of area names in the order you want them to appear.  Amazing.</p>
<p>And then, for no apparent reason, I started understanding the rest of it.  What hadn’t been working previously was working now.  It must have been something I was doing wrong, but I still have no idea what that was.  It was like I had been tapping on an egg, trying to get inside, and as soon a small crack appeared, I was able to get to the egg effortlessly.  </p>
<p>It happened when I decided I wanted to make my input fields align with each other, rather than the jagged placement based on the length of each one’s label.  For that, I decided I would learn Flexbox.  Again, initially it made no sense.  But once I started to grasp the concepts behind it, the styling began to flow.</p>

        <p>There’s nothing like a bit of praise first thing in the morning.  I woke up to this from the Rockbite Games representative who hangs out on the Deep Town subreddit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve shown this to our team, and they love it! Keep it up, the bots are proud of you! No, really this is very impressive. We’ll try to check the GitHub repo on the weekend if there is some time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s all, but that’s all it takes.  A hint of recognition for my work, and from someone whose opinion is more than slightly informed.</p>
<p>Maybe I should get to commenting on my code…</p>

        <p>I recently switched from using SublimeText3 to VSCode, mostly based on the recommendation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL-6AbQOM4c" target="_blank" rel="external">this video</a>.  Yep, I’m easily persuaded.</p>
<p>I like it a lot.  There are some differences I don’t particularly like, but in general, I find it more intuitive.  I feel like I don’t have to spend as much time figuring out how the program works, so I can spend more time figuring out how to make my own code work.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint is that it came with ESLint pre-installed, and I couldn’t for the life of me make it work.  I still don’t know what I did wrong.  But no matter.  It’s not the only ball game.</p>
<p>So I installed JSHint, which I had been using in Sublime.  The problem is that it shows errors differently.  In Sublime, it puts an icon in the margin to tell you that there’s an error, while in VSCode, it puts a squiggly underline under the error, which is often a single character.  It’s almost impossible to see that it’s indicating an error.</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s an option to make it look less bad, but I’m disappointed that it doesn’t look good by default.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Today I shared DeepTownCalc with Reddit, and I got some great feedback.  Some spurred additional research, and some gave some great ideas for future development.  Here are some things I’ve been thinking about.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Viewport metadata</strong> - I honestly don’t know why this isn’t built into every browser as the default, but apparently I should be adding this to pretty much everything I do from now on:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p> Because in what world are forms that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YLbNFzl.png" target="_blank" rel="external">look like this</a> acceptable?  It’s funny how for site that claims, “Websites aren’t broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible,”[sic] <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">the <em>one thing</em> they’ve done</a> that affects the way the page looks is to add that one piece of metadata.</p>
<p> If it’s not going to be default browser behavior, shouldn’t every HTML tutorial in the world mention it?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sliders</strong> - A user requested the ability to use both coal and charcoal in DTC.  I explained the challenge and why I chose to keep them separate, and the user came back with the suggestion of using a slider to indicate the ratio you want to use.  The slider itself would come in the styling portion of development (i.e., last), but getting proportional quantities should be doable.  That may also be useful for when (if) I make mining times, allowing users to enter a ratio of online to offline time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>We don’t need no stinking batches</strong> - Apparently something I’ve done has messed up my batch solutions.  Gotta figure that one out.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Buttons are just buttons</strong> - I had originally used <code>preventDefault()</code> on my buttons to keep them from reloading the page.  I wondered if that was necessary, and I found that it wasn’t. You just had to set it to <code>&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code>.  If you tell it that a button is just a button, it’s no longer a submit.  But that also means that if you’re in a text field and hit enter, it does nothing.  I find that annoying.  So I think I’m going to have to go back to <code>preventDefault()</code>, at least for the one button.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stop getting stuff you don’t need</strong> - This is something I did when I was figuring out a reasonable algorithm in a spreadsheet.  Once you reach a <code>weightedNeed</code> of 0 for a material, it shouldn’t be considering that material anymore when it comes to choosing a mine.  If you don’t need any more copper, but you need tons of coal, area 1 <code>{ coal: 100 }</code> is better than area 2 <code>{ coal: 70, copper: 30 }</code>, but the way it is now, those are both equal.</p>
<p> I think I can do that at the time when it finds a weightedNeed that’s less than 0.  I’ll have to loop through <code>sortingMines</code> and remove it, then recalculate <code>howMuch</code> for each mine.  But I think it will make the decisions better.  I’ll call it a low priority.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Incorporate existing materials</strong> - I have to figure out a way for users to include their existing materials.  That will affect the chosen mines a lot.  It will have to go into <code>makeInputNeeds</code>, before <code>findMines</code>.  I can just have it make an array of the materials and quantities, then subtract it from <code>needsList</code> before it starts picking mines.</p>
<p> The input will take some thought, but maybe I can have it create hidden inputs during <code>displayResults</code>.  Then in the click listener, I can have it reuse the loop that makes <code>itemArray</code>.  DRY code!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Styling</strong> - Yeah, it’s last, but it’s going to be annoying.  I guess I just want to figure out the full functionality here before I invest a lot of time to how it looks.  I don’t want to duplicate much more work than necessary.</p>
<p> But I do know that I want to use it as an opportunity to learn and practice CSS Grid.  I don’t want to rely on any third-party framework.  I like knowing that I can use them, but I don’t want to have a crutch.  We’re trying to do at least some of these things the hard way, people.  I mean, how much easier would a lot of this be in jQuery?  Probably a lot.</p>

        <p>I fixed the issue from last night where some materials never reached a high enough priority to be mined.  As I had planned, I broke <code>miningAlgorithm</code> into two pieces: one that calculates priority and chooses what material to mine, and another, <code>chooseMine</code>, which chooses the best mine where you can find that material.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that caused another problem, but I’ll have to get back to that.  The good thing is that I learned more about using function expressions.</p>
<p>I made a function expression <code>let priority = function () {/* yadda yadda */}</code>.  That checked to see if we’re running out of available mines (<code>if (i &gt;= availableMines - minableNeeds)</code>) and we loop through each of the minable needs to make sure there’s at least one mine for each need.  If not, the we return the need we’re looking at.  If there’s at least one mine, we return the top priority as per <code>miningAlgorithm</code>.  If we’re not in the last few available mines, we also return the top priority per the algorithm.</p>
<p>Once I have returned <code>priority</code> I can call <code>chooseMine(priority(), i)</code>.  I was not expecting to have to use the parentheses in the parameters, but now that I’m thinking of it, that makes sense.  It means when it finds that it needs <code>priority</code>, it has to call it as a function.  Otherwise, it passes in the text of the function, which helps no one.</p>
<p>And that works great.  Except when there are no mines left that contain the designated priority.</p>
<p>Previously, I had been looping through <code>needsList</code>, which was recently sorted by priority.  If I ran out of mines for one material, it would automatically move on to the next highest priority.</p>
<p>But now that I’m determining the top priority, I though there would be no need to loop through <code>needsList</code> yet again.  I got rid of the loop, and I was happy for slightly cleaner code.  Alas.</p>
<p>Instead, of returning <code>priority</code>, I’m going to have to move the position of the desired material in <code>needsList</code>.  Then I can loop through it, just as I had been before.</p>
<p>To do this, I think I can <code>unshift()</code> to make room at index 0, copy the desired material, and <code>splice()</code> the old one out.  Luckily, I want the priority at the beginning of the array, so I don’t have to go and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2440723/7691610" target="_blank" rel="external">do something like this</a>.</p>
<p>That also means I probably won’t need a function expression.  Oh well.</p>

        <p>In DTC, I’m having a problem with prioritizing mines.  There are some instances in which a material has such a low priority that none of the ordered mines have the material.  I need to make it so at least one mine produces every material.</p>
<p>Right now I’m looking at putting that in <code>miningAlgorithm</code> after the priority has been calculated, but before the mine has been chosen.</p>
<p>First, I need to see how many minable materials I’m working with.  I could loop through <code>needsList</code> again, but there may be a better place to do this, such as counting at the time each material is being pushed to <code>needsList</code>.  We’ll call that number <code>minableNeeds</code>.</p>
<p>Then, I’ll check to see if we’ve assigned almost all the other mines already.  I want the top priorities assigned first, then at the end check for orphaned materials.  Something like <code>if (i &gt; availableMines - minableNeeds)</code></p>
<p>Next I have to go through each of <code>needsList</code> (yet again) to make sure that the material is minable.  If it is, check it against <code>sortingMines</code> to see if the material is being mined.  If not, then I have to loop through all the mines and find the one with the material and the highest <code>howMuch</code>.</p>
<p>I wonder if looping through the same data over and over is common, or if I’ve set myself up for frustration from the beginning.  I also think it may be time to break up some of my bigger functions.  <code>miningAlgorithm</code> alone is up to about 85 lines.  </p>
<p>Actually, that may be the solution to my problem.  If I split the second half of <code>miningAlgorithm</code> into its own function, I can pass it any material I want, not strictly the material with the highest priority.  </p>
<p>So I’ll calculate the highest priority in one function, then decide whether I need to override that priority with an orphaned material.  The winner of that battle gets passed into the mine choosing function.</p>
<p>I’ll get to work on that tomorrow.</p>

        <p>I made a friend last night.  </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ovIbb4Q.jpg" alt="Bat"></p>
<p>I was in the middle of setting up this very Hexo blog when he flew in and circled the living room a few dozen times, looking for a way out.  </p>
<p>Eventually, he landed in a basket, so I threw an old towel over it and took it outside.  </p>
<p>Reddit says it’s probably a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_brown_bat" target="_blank" rel="external">big brown bat</a>.  </p>
<p>Farewell my friend!  Gorge yourself on all the insects you like, just stay out of the house next time.</p>
